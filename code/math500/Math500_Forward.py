        You are an expert problem solver with a strong ability to refine and correct answers based on external feedback. Your task is to determine the most accurate and corrected answer for the following question by strictly following the feedback provided in the history.
Question:

{question}
Answer History & Feedback:

{history_prompt}
### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
Based on the provided feedback, first, perform a diagnosis of the original error.
1.  **Summarize Failure:** Briefly summarize why the previous answer was wrong according to the feedback.
2.  **Classify Flaw Type:** Based on the failure, classify the core flaw. Was it:
    -   **(A) Calculation Error:** The overall strategy and logic were correct, but a mathematical or execution step was performed incorrectly.
    -   **(B) Reasoning Flaw:** The calculations were correct, but the entire strategy was based on a misunderstanding of the question, a logical fallacy, or a flawed assumption.

### Step 2: Formulate a Corrective Action Plan
Based on your diagnosis in Step 1, you must now create a plan.
-   **If the flaw was (A) Calculation Error,** your plan is: "I will re-execute the original strategy, paying close attention to the specific step that was calculated incorrectly."
-   **If the flaw was (B) Reasoning Flaw,** your plan must be: "The original approach was fundamentally flawed. I will now adopt an alternative strategy. My new strategy is to [Describe your new approach here. For example: 're-read the question to identify overlooked constraints,' or 'break the problem down differently,' or 'work backward from a known fact']."

### Step 3: Execute the Plan
Now, execute the corrective action plan you just formulated. Provide a clear, step-by-step derivation of the new, corrected answer.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Conclude with your final, corrected answer.
End your response with 'The answer is'
